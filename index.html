        <p>Kayle my soul mate, the most amazing person on the planet</p>
        <p>You are amazingly beautiful in every way possible. 2 years into our relationship and I still get butterflies in my stomach both when I see you after a break and also when I think about who you are as a person.</p>
        <p>You are amazingly kind, one in a billion. The amount of kindness you have for everyone and anyone is exemplary and if the world would just take 20% of your kindness we would live in a better place</p>
        <p>You are amazingly caring, what you have given me makes me feel more supported than ever in my life. The opportunity to change my life from where I was pre meeting you to now, I look back and think they are two different life.</p>
        <p>You are amazingly patient, you are slow to anger and quick to forgive. Being with you is changing me in a positive way. I am learning to be more calm over time.(maybe too slowly :P)</p>
        <p>Getting to share my life with you is simply amazing. You make me so happy and these are just some of the many more reasons why I love you so much.</p>
        <p>Have a great 24th birthday and enjoy spending it with your family. There will be many birthdays I get to spend with you in the future.</p>
